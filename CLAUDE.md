# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working on the GarageOS repository.

## Project overview

GarageOS is a multi-tenant SaaS that digitizes vehicle maintenance logbooks for Italian mechanical workshops. Workshops (tenants) register interventions on vehicles; customers (B2C) see their vehicle history in a mobile app.

**Tech stack:**
- Backend: Fastify + TypeScript + Prisma
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL (DB-only mode — we don't use Supabase Auth or Storage)
- Web app (officine): React + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- Mobile app (clienti): React Native + Expo managed workflow
- Infrastructure: AWS via CDK (App Runner, Cognito, S3, EventBridge, SES, CloudFront, Route 53, WAF)

## Documentation hierarchy

**Always consult the relevant documentation before implementing a feature.** The repo contains ~13,000 lines of specifications in `docs/`:

| File | When to read |
|---|---|
| `docs/GarageOS-Specifiche.md` | Master document — start here for any feature |
| `docs/APPENDICE_A_API.md` | Implementing or calling REST endpoints |
| `docs/APPENDICE_B_DATABASE.md` | Schema changes, migrations, Prisma queries, RLS |
| `docs/APPENDICE_C_INFRASTRUCTURE.md` | AWS, CDK, GitHub Actions, deployment |
| `docs/APPENDICE_E_TESTING.md` | Writing tests, choosing test type |
| `docs/APPENDICE_F_BUSINESS_LOGIC.md` | **ALWAYS read before implementing business logic** — 130+ coded business rules |
| `docs/APPENDICE_G_ERROR_CODES.md` | Throwing or handling errors, API error responses |

**Rule:** when a documentation file conflicts with your instinct, the documentation wins. If you think the documentation is wrong, raise it in the PR description — do not silently diverge.

## Business rules are non-negotiable

`docs/APPENDICE_F_BUSINESS_LOGIC.md` contains rules coded as `BR-XXX`. Examples:

- `BR-001` — VIN uniqueness
- `BR-020` — garage_code format
- `BR-040` — one active owner per vehicle
- `BR-062` — wiki editing window for interventions
- `BR-151` — customer PII visibility based on relation

When you implement a feature:
1. Grep for related `BR-XXX` codes in the doc
2. Cite them in code comments (e.g. `// See BR-068 for odometer validation rules`)
3. Write a test that verifies each BR (pattern in `docs/APPENDICE_E_TESTING.md` §8)

## Git workflow — MANDATORY

**Never commit directly to `main`.** Branch protection on the repo is not enforced technically (GitHub Free plan limitation) but we follow the workflow as if it were. This is a hard rule.

### Branch naming

Use prefixes:
- `feat/short-description` — new features
- `fix/bug-description` — bug fixes
- `chore/description` — maintenance (CI config, dependency bumps, tooling)
- `refactor/description` — refactoring without behavior change
- `docs/description` — documentation only
- `test/description` — test-only changes

Branch names are lowercase, hyphen-separated, concise.

**Examples:**
- ✅ `feat/vehicle-registration-endpoint`
- ✅ `fix/km-decrease-validation`
- ✅ `chore/update-prisma-to-5.23`
- ❌ `my-branch` (no prefix)
- ❌ `feat/Added_the_new_Vehicle_Endpoint` (wrong casing, underscores)

### Workflow for every change

```bash
# 1. Always start from updated main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feat/short-description

# 3. Make changes, commit often with meaningful messages
git add -A
git commit -m "feat(api): add POST /vehicles endpoint"

# 4. Push to remote
git push origin feat/short-description

# 5. Open a PR on GitHub via `gh` CLI
# 6. Watch CI until ALL checks are green
gh pr checks <n> --watch

# 7. Squash-merge the PR yourself (self-merge authorized by Michele, 2026-06-10)
gh pr merge <n> --squash --delete-branch

# 8. Sync local main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -D feat/short-description
```

### Self-merge rules (Claude Code)

Claude Code squash-merges its own PRs. Branch protection on `main` still **requires a PR** (direct pushes are blocked) but requires **0 approvals** — changed by the repo owner on 2026-06-10 precisely to enable self-merge; no `--admin` bypass is needed or allowed. Non-negotiable preconditions, ALL required before merging:

1. **CI is fully green** (`gh pr checks` — every check). GitHub has no required-checks list on this repo, so a merge over red CI *would* technically succeed: doing so is forbidden (see "Things Claude Code must NEVER do" #4).
2. The **final whole-branch review gate** for the task size has passed (see "Right-sizing the workflow to the task").
3. **No open questions for the user**: if the PR contains a spec deviation, an LOC-limit exception, a migration, or anything flagged "ask the user" by these rules, stop and wait for explicit approval before merging.
4. The user can always say "wait for my review" on any PR — that overrides self-merge for that PR.

Merge method is always "Squash and merge" (`--squash`); never merge commits or rebase merges.

### Force push

- ❌ **NEVER force-push to `main`.** This is irreversible and destroys shared history.
- ✅ Force-push on your own feature branches is acceptable (e.g. after rebase), but prefer `git push --force-with-lease` over `--force` to avoid overwriting unseen changes.

## Commit message convention — Conventional Commits

All commits follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). This enables automatic CHANGELOG generation and semantic versioning in v1.1+.

**Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary in imperative present>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat` — new feature
- `fix` — bug fix
- `chore` — maintenance, tooling, deps
- `docs` — documentation only
- `test` — tests only
- `refactor` — code change without behavior change
- `perf` — performance improvement
- `ci` — CI/CD config change
- `build` — build system change
- `revert` — revert a previous commit

**Scopes** (for a monorepo):
- `api`, `web`, `mobile`, `database`, `infra`, `shared`, `e2e`, or `deps`

**Examples:**
- ✅ `feat(api): add POST /vehicles endpoint`
- ✅ `fix(web): correct login redirect loop on safari`
- ✅ `docs: update README tech stack`
- ✅ `chore(deps): bump prisma to 5.23`
- ✅ `test(api): add BR-068 km validation tests`
- ❌ `Added stuff` (no type, not imperative)
- ❌ `fix: bug` (too vague)

**Summary rules:**
- Lowercase first letter
- Imperative present ("add", not "added" or "adds")
- No trailing period
- Max 72 characters

**Body (optional):**
- Use when the commit needs explanation beyond the summary
- Explain **why**, not **what** (the diff shows what)
- Wrap at 72 chars

## Pull Request guidelines

### Title

PR title follows the same Conventional Commits format as commit messages:
- ✅ `feat(api): vehicle registration endpoint with garage_code generation`
- ❌ `New feature` or `Updates`

### Description

Every PR description must include:

```markdown
## What

Brief description of the change.

## Why

Link to the feature spec (F-XXX-YYY from docs/GarageOS-Specifiche.md §3) or
the business rule (BR-XXX from docs/APPENDICE_F_BUSINESS_LOGIC.md) that motivated this.

## Implementation notes

- Key architectural choices made
- Anything non-obvious in the diff

## Tests

- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Integration tests added/updated
- [ ] Manual smoke test on local env
- [ ] BR-XXX rules verified (list them)

## Screenshots (if UI)

[attach]

## Checklist

- [ ] Code follows conventions in CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Types compile (`pnpm typecheck`)
- [ ] Linter clean (`pnpm lint`)
- [ ] Tests pass (`pnpm test:unit` and `pnpm test:integration`)
- [ ] No new `console.log`, no commented-out code
- [ ] Secrets not committed (verify with `git diff --staged`)
- [ ] Documentation updated if API/BR/schema changed
```

### PR size

- Target: **<500 lines changed** per PR
- Hard limit: **<1500 lines**
- If a change is inherently bigger (e.g. initial scaffold), split into smaller PRs or explicitly justify in the description
- Giant PRs are hard to review and hide bugs

### Merge method

**Always use "Squash and merge"**. Never "Create a merge commit" or "Rebase and merge".

Rationale:
- Linear history on `main`
- Every commit on `main` = one feature/fix (easy to revert)
- Avoids merge commits polluting log

The squash commit message should be the PR title + a reference to the PR number (GitHub auto-generates this).

## Things Claude Code must NEVER do

1. **Never commit secrets.** Even in `.env.example`, use placeholder values. Real secrets go to AWS Secrets Manager or `.env` (gitignored).
2. **Never push to `main` directly.** Always open a PR. Self-merging the PR is allowed (see "Self-merge rules"), pushing commits to `main` is not. Never use `gh pr merge --admin` or otherwise bypass branch protection.
3. **Never force-push to `main`.** On feature branches: use `--force-with-lease`, not `--force`.
4. **Never bypass CI failures** by disabling checks or merging with red status.
5. **Never delete the `main` branch** or rename it without explicit user approval.
6. **Never rewrite git history on `main`** (no `git commit --amend` or `git rebase -i` on merged commits).
7. **Never add a new npm/pnpm dependency** without justifying it in the PR description. Prefer standard library / existing deps.
8. **Never write migrations that drop columns or tables without user approval.** Follow the expand → migrate → contract pattern (see `docs/APPENDICE_B_DATABASE.md` §9.7).
9. **Never disable RLS policies** to "make tests pass." If a test fails because of RLS, the test setup is wrong, not the policy.
10. **Never commit `node_modules`, `.env`, `dist/`, `cdk.out/`, or any generated file.** Verify `.gitignore` covers them.

## When in doubt

1. **Stop and ask the user.** It's better to pause a task than to produce code that violates a hidden rule.
2. **Prefer small, reversible changes** over clever one-shot rewrites.
3. **Check `docs/`** — 90% of architectural questions are already answered.
4. **If the spec is ambiguous, note it in the PR description** and propose an interpretation — don't silently decide.

## Code style

- **TypeScript strict mode** enabled; no `any` without justification in comment
- **Prettier** for formatting (config in root `.prettierrc`)
- **ESLint** for linting (config in root `eslint.config.mjs`)
- **No emoji in code or commit messages** (emoji are fine in README, docs, PR descriptions)
- **Comments in English**, even if the documentation is in Italian (code is international; only user-facing strings are localized to Italian)
- **User-facing strings** (error messages, UI labels) are in Italian and go through the i18n system — never hardcoded

## Testing

**Local pre-PR gate is intentionally minimal — full validation runs on CI.**

The only mandatory local check before pushing is **typecheck**, enforced by the husky pre-push hook (`.husky/pre-push`):

```bash
pnpm -r typecheck   # ~30s, runs automatically on `git push`
```

Everything else (lint, format, commitlint, test:unit, test:integration, cdk-synth) is gated by GitHub Actions on every PR — see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. **Do not run those locally by default.** The reasons:

- `test:unit` for `infrastructure/` bundles the Lambda 3 times via esbuild (~30-45s of disk-heavy I/O) and freezes Windows machines.
- `test:integration` requires Docker + Testcontainers and is even worse.
- Running them locally + on CI duplicates 5-7 min of work per PR cycle for negligible safety gain.

If CI fails after the push, fix and push a follow-up commit. Watch CI status with `gh pr checks --watch` (or `gh run watch`).

**Optional local commands** (for debugging only, not gates):

```bash
pnpm test:fast            # lint + typecheck + test:unit — only when modifying business logic and you want a quick sanity check
pnpm --filter <pkg> test  # narrow run while debugging a specific failure
pnpm --filter @garageos/database test:integration   # ONLY to reproduce a CI failure or modify scaffolding
```

Never run `pnpm test:integration` (root) locally unless explicitly instructed — it spins up Docker for both database + api integration suites and will likely freeze the machine.

See `docs/APPENDICE_E_TESTING.md` for the full testing strategy, including which `BR-XXX` rules require explicit tests.

## Right-sizing the workflow to the task

The slow part of a change is rarely the tests — those already run on CI in parallel (see above). The cost driver is applying the **full heavyweight review pipeline** (plan doc → one subagent per task → 3-4 review stages → smoke runbook → final review) to a small change. That pipeline was calibrated in the Opus 4.x era; with current models the implementer drifts less and review stages consolidate. It remains appropriate only for **large vertical slices (≥6 tasks, cross-layer)**, not for a single additive endpoint or component.

**Match the process to the task size:**

- **Small / additive change** (one endpoint, one component, an isolated fix): lightweight plan, implement directly, then **one final whole-branch review via `/code-review`** (medium effort). No subagent-per-task, no multi-stage review.
- **Medium change** (2-5 tasks, single layer): implement task-by-task (subagents optional), then **`/code-review high`** on the whole branch.
- **Large slice** (≥6 tasks, cross-layer): subagent-driven implementation per task. Per-task reviewers only for the riskiest tasks (new public API surface, security/RLS, migrations); everything else is covered by the final whole-branch gate: **`/code-review high`**, or **`/code-review ultra`** for the biggest slices. For a parallel multi-dimension review fan-out, the Workflow tool may be used (it requires explicit opt-in in the prompt).

**Rules that survive any model generation:**

- The **final whole-branch review is load-bearing — never skip it.** It is the only gate that cross-references `schema.prisma`, `APPENDICE_F`/`APPENDICE_G`, and cross-task consistency (per-task reviewers read diffs in isolation by design).
- **Do not hardcode model names** (sonnet/opus/haiku) in specs, plans, or review prescriptions. Subagents inherit the session model by default, which is the strongest available; "final Opus review" in older specs/plans means "final whole-branch review with the strongest available model".
- The **smoke runbook stays mandatory** for UI/shell/layout PRs and anything device-facing — no review stage replaces it.
- Implementation plans follow `docs/superpowers/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` (includes the mandatory pre-flight grep checklist).

**Local feedback loop (fastest first):**

1. `pnpm -r typecheck` — automatic on push, catches the most common break (~30s).
2. **Only if you changed a route handler**, add a targeted `pnpm --filter @garageos/api test:unit` (~30-45s) — typecheck does not catch broken `FakePrisma` mocks.
3. Push and let CI run the full matrix in parallel: `gh pr checks --watch`.

Do not propose "move tests to CI" as an optimization — that is already the design.

## Questions?

If you need clarification on any rule here or in the documentation, ask the user before proceeding. Reading the relevant `docs/APPENDICE_*.md` file usually answers the question.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
